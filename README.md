# Conway's Game of Life: Java Simulation

This is a project created for my Grade 12 Introduction to Computer Science course. Written in Java, it features full GUI support for graphically editing and saving patterns. 

A screenshot from the program:

This program simulates lifeforms in a colony according to the rules outlined by Conway's Game of Life (available at http://www.math.com/students/wonders/life/life.html). It provides tools such as rectangular marquee population/eradication and freestyle drawing to allow the user to interact with the colony, as well as preset colonies that can be loaded. The user can choose to run the simulation or advance it manually. They can also save and load text files that store a colony's cell information. Various settings can be changed--zoom, population/eradication success rate, and simulation speed. 

The abbreviations on the buttons indicate:

 - Pop - Rectangular marquee for population
 - Erad - Rectangular marquee for eradication
 - Free - Freestyle drawing for population
 - Clr - Clear screen
 - R-P - R-Pentomino (PATTERN)
 - Gun - Glider Gun (PATTERN)
 - Plsr - Pulsar (PATTERN)
 - Die - Die Hard (PATTERN)
 - Pffr - Puffers (PATTERN)
